Description: Go library for encoding and decoding PKCS#12 files (library)
 This package implements some of PKCS#12 (also known as P12 or PFX). It
 is intended for decoding DER-encoded P12/PFX files for use with the
 crypto/tls package, and for encoding P12/PFX files for use by legacy
 applications which do not support newer formats.  Since PKCS#12 uses
 weak encryption primitives, it SHOULD NOT be used for new applications.
 .
 Note that only DER-encoded PKCS#12 files are supported, even though
 PKCS#12 allows BER encoding.  This is because encoding/asn1 only
 supports DER.
